I'm a **Software Developer** with a passion for building robust and scalable applications, actively coding since **2008**.

Currently, I'm diving deep into the exciting world of **Generative AI**! I'm expanding my knowledge through courses on Coursera, Udemy, Android Developers, and Microsoft Learning. I'm also upskilling in **AWS** via Coursera to enhance my cloud development expertise. I have my GitHub page at {https://saishaddai.github.io/}. You can check up my experience, publications, learning path and some personal projects I'm working on.
